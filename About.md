## Significance of the excess lags

Rather large discrepancies occurred between
	range data from USSTRATCOM's SSN radars
and
	NASA's Doppler-integrated range
during NEAR's Earth flyby on 23rd January 1998 
	[1].
These radar residuals have never been considered
	in JPL's subsequent papers on
		various anomalies 
	(e.g., [2]).
In fact,
the radar data also obtained for Galileo
	had not even been examined till after NEAR's flyby
	[1],
and were eventually found similar,
	as privately revealed by J K Campbell
		early on in this work.
NEAR's radar residuals were shown in
	[3]
to not only closely fit
	the instantaneous range as _range lags_
		_&Delta;r=-v.&Delta;t_,
where
	_v_ is the spacecraft's range range
		and _&Delta;t_, the one-way light time,
but also explain
	NEAR's velocity anomaly
as the corresponding _velocity lags_
	_&Delta;v=-a.&Delta;t_,
where
	_a_ denotes the instantaneous radial acceleration.
These lags are in _excess_,
	since one way travel delays
		_&Delta;t&equiv;r/c_
	are already corrected for in computing
		the spacecraft velocity and acceleration
	from the received signal.


The implication that
	the telemetry Doppler had range proportional shifts
		is fundamentally problematic for current physics,
as it means that
	the shifts can result simply from wave propagation
		at the extremely short range of Earth orbits,
and thus with no dependence on
	an expanding space-time metric
		as currently required for
			the cosmological shifts. 
The only other velocity variable available
	for interpreting these range errors
		in terms of time
	is the speed of light _c_,
i.e.,
	as _&Delta;r=-c.&Delta;t_.
That makes it
	the only alternative explanation
		at all allowed by the context,
but it entails
	a difference in speeds between
		radar and telemetry signals,
	in itself
		an aether-theoretic hypothesis
	[4],
and crucially would not explain how
	this difference is peculiar to
		NEAR's flyby
	and absent in Juno's,
		which was at almost the same altitude
	[5].
The excess lags are thus
	the only possible explanation,
and are implied by
	the carrier phase lock condition at the transponder
		as a chirp spectral mode
	[3].
The specificity to older spacecrafts
	including Galileo, NEAR and Rosetta
correlates with
	a substantial change in
		the transponder carrier loop design
	after Cassini
	[6].


Coupling to the Earth's magnetic field
	has been hypothesized
to reconcile
	the absence of the anomaly in later flybys
		with a frame-dragging explanation for the anomalies
	[7].
There is clearly no way to reconcile
	the radar residuals with any space-time mechanism,
however,
even if we ignored their _kilometre-scale_ magnitudes
	[8],
again because
	the radar and telemetry signals followed essentially
		the same paths,
	as remarked.


In hindsight,
the traditional notion of _translational symmetry_ of waves
	against range proportional shifts
is specific to
	sinusoidal eigenfunctions
		and therefore to Fourier spectra.
The standard deviation S = 126.59 m
	and mean square error R = 654.153 m
		&equiv; 5.1675 S
	(see JPL's own annotation at the top of
		the [residuals figure](ref/Antreasian/fig10_near_SSNrange.pdf))
makes NEAR's radar residuals already a 5&sigma; dataset
	against translational symmetry being
		a law of nature.
There are other, deeper issues with
	current astrophysics,
including that
	the nuclear distributions and
		the Planck character of the background radiation
	more simply fit
		an infinitely vast and old universe
but for the rather limited age of the universe<sup>a</sup>
	imposed by the translational symmetry premise
		for the Hubble shifts
	(cf [9]).
The practical significance of
	the chirp modes
for communication, radar and imaging technologies
	here on Earth
	[10]
seems to far outweigh
	the philosophical issues of astrophysics,
	however.
