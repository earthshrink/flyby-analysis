## Significance of the excess lags

Rather large discrepancies occurred between
	range data from USSTRATCOM's SSN radars
and
	NASA's Doppler-integrated range
during NEAR's Earth flyby on 23rd January 1998 
	[1].
These radar residuals had remained unconsidered
	in all of JPL's subsequent papers on
		various anomalies 
	[2].
They were shown in
	[3]
to not only closely fit
	the instantaneous range as _range lags_
		_&Delta;r=-v.&Delta;t_,
where
	_v_ is the spacecraft's range range
		and _&Delta;t_, the one-way light time,
but also explain
	NEAR's velocity anomaly
as the corresponding _velocity lags_
	_&Delta;v=-a.&Delta;t_,
where
	_a_ denotes the instantaneous radial acceleration.
These lags are in _excess_,
	since one way travel delays
		_&Delta;t&equiv;r/c_
	are already corrected for in computing
		the spacecraft velocity and acceleration
	from the received signal.


The implication that
	the telemetry Doppler had range proportional shifts
		is fundamentally problematic for current physics,
as it means that
	the shifts can result simply from wave propagation
		at the extremely short range of Earth orbits,
and thus with no dependence on
	an expanding space-time metric
		as currently required for
			the cosmological shifts. 
The only other velocity variable available in the context
	for interpreting these range errors
		in terms of time
	is the speed of light _c_.
This is therefore
	the only possible alternative explanation,
but it entails
	a difference in speeds between
		radar and telemetry signals,
	in itself
		an aether-theoretic hypothesis
	[4],
and would also not explain how
	this difference is peculiar to
		NEAR's flyby
	and absent in Juno's,
		which was at almost the same altitude
	[5].
On the other hand,
the excess lags are implied by
	the carrier phase lock condition at the transponder
		as a chirp spectral mode
	[3],
and the transponder carrier loop design
	was changed after NEAR
	[6].


In hindsight,
the traditional notion of _translational symmetry_ of waves
	against range proportional shifts
is specific to
	sinusoidal eigenfunctions
		and therefore to Fourier spectra.
NEAR's radar residuals were already a 5&sigma; dataset
	against this notion.
There are other deep issues with
	current astrophysics,
including that
	the nuclear distributions and
		the Planck character of the background radiation
	more simply fit
		an infinitely vast and old universe
but for the rather limited age of the universe<sup>a</sup>
	imposed by the translational symmetry premise
		for the Hubble shifts
	(cf [7]).
The practical significance of
	the chirp modes
for communication, radar and imaging technologies
	here on Earth
	[8]
seems to far outweigh
	the philosophical issues of astrophysics,
	however.
